# Bayesian Networks-Survival
This project seeks to introduce the topic of Bayesian networks as well as basic concepts of survival analysis in order to bring together both branches of statistics and implement models that help us to estimate survival probabilities given a time T.

## Conclusions 
This approach makes the data easier to interpret. For example, it is intuitive to think that networks can make estimates over time. Imagine we are talking about a disease where it is less likely to survive in the first few days, but as time passes, that probability increases significantly. Bayesian networks reflect this relationship clearly. In contrast, the Cox proportional hazards model fails to show this relationship as clearly.
